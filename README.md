A minimalist Kanban board to track job applications and networking connections.

## Features

- 🤝 **Dual Entity System**: Track connections and job applications together

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/pachocamacho/personal-job-board
python3 server.py
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

> **Why a server?** Browsers block localStorage on `file://` URLs. The server enables proper data persistence.

**Connections (🤝)**: Networking contacts that may lead to opportunities
- Fields: Contact Name, Organization, Company, Position, Location, Salary

**Jobs (💼)**: Formal applications to specific roles  
- Fields: Company, Position, Location, Salary

**Star Ratings**: Click a star (1-5) to set priority level

**Workflow**: Interested → Applied → Interview → Offer → Rejected

## Data Storage

Data lives in your browser's localStorage. To keep your data:
- Use the same browser
- Access via http://localhost:8000
- Don't clear browser data

**View in Chrome DevTools**: Application tab → Local Storage → http://localhost:8000
