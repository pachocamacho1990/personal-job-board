A minimalist, **self-hosted Kanban board** to track job applications and networking opportunities. Now powered by **Docker**, **PostgreSQL**, and a secure **User Authentication** system.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔐 Multi-User Authentication**: Secure signup/login with password hashing and JWT sessions.
- **🐳 Dockerized Deployment**: One command to start Database, API, and Web Server.
- **💾 PostgreSQL Database**: Robust data persistence (no more browser localStorage limits).
-   **🤝 Dual Entity System**: Track both **Connections** (networking) and **Jobs** (applications).
-   **🤖 Job Origin Indicator**: Distinguish between Human 👤 and AI Agent 🤖 created jobs.
-   **✨ Shine Effect**: New Agent-created jobs glow purple until viewed (unseen state).
-   **⭐ Star Ratings**: Prioritize opportunities with a 1-5 star rating system.
- **📱 Responsive & Fast**: Optimized mobile view and lightweight frontend.
- **🔄 Migration Tools**: Seamlessly import data from previous localStorage versions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
