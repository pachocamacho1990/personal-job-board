# Release v3.2.0 — Archive Vault

> **Feature Release**: Introduces the **Archive Vault** to manage and store completed job cards, keeping your main board clean and focused.

## 🎯 Highlights

The **Archive Vault** allows you to move interested, applied, or rejected jobs off your active board into a dedicated "Vault". Archived jobs are preserved with their full history and can be restored at any time.

## ✨ What's New

### 📦 Archive Vault
- **Archive Action**: New "Archive 📦" button in the Job Detail panel.
- **Vault Modal**: View all archived jobs in a clean, list-based layout.
- **Restore Capability**: One-click restore to bring jobs back to the board with their original status.
- **Custom Confirmation**: dedicated, styled modal for archive actions (replacing browser alerts).

### 🎨 UI & Visualization
- **Journey Map Update**: The status timeline now includes "Archived" as a final stage.
- **Status Dropdown**: Fixed missing "Pending" status and optimized order.
- **Glassmorphism**: Enhanced modal styles for a modern feel.
